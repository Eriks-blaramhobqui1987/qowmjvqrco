Oh man, I'm sitting here, the theater still feels like a foggy dream. Crumbs everywhere—popcorn clinging to me like needy little shadows. My back is... let's call it 'screaming opera' after those seats. But Ask Sadece Bir An. WOW. Kinda like if lightning had a love child with a soap bubble. The way the light hit their faces in that last scene! Like, if I could capture that in a photo, I’d retire. I wish.

It starts and it’s like, BAM! Colors. Sound. Some scene keeps replaying in my head—the one with the cat. Or was it a dog? Either way, the animal did something so human it was absurd.

I have this blurry photo in my mind’s eye of one of the last scenes. Faces turning like they were searching for something in a junk drawer. Yeah, that's it, like a junk drawer. Chaotic but there’s treasure if you look closely enough.

Somebody once asked me where to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Don't remember who, doesn't matter now. It's all swimming in a fog of post-  daze. My fingers taste like butter and salt, like my thoughts, I guess.
